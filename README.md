This project implemetns K-means clustering to cluster the text documents inside the dataset_3 folder.
Simply run the Main.java file to get all the results.
Running the project will generate the followings in the main project folder:
1. Visual representation of clusters generated by my program named "MyClusters.png"
2. Visual representation of target clusters named "TargetClusterss.png"
3. "topics.txt" that includes 7 most important the topics selected from each of the clusters.
4. "clusterMatrix.txt" that summarizes which text documents were placed in which cluster.
5. "confusionMatrix.txt" that summarizes the confusion matrix calculation done.
6. "PCA.csv" that contains the reduced dimensionality information of the data.
